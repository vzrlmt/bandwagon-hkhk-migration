# BandwagonHost Hong Kong HKHK_3 & HKHK_8 Network Upgrade: Enhanced Migration, Faster CN2 GIA Performance

---

BandwagonHost just rolled out some serious network upgrades to their Hong Kong data centers, and honestly? It's about time. If you've been dealing with sluggish connections or wondering whether their Hong Kong nodes are worth the premium, this update changes the game. The HKHK_3 and HKHK_8 facilities now deliver noticeably faster speeds and rock-solid stability—exactly what you need when every millisecond counts for your cross-border business or media streaming setup.

## What Actually Changed

BandwagonHost expanded network capacity at both **HKHK_3** and **HKHK_8** data centers. Translation: less congestion, smoother traffic flow, better performance during peak hours.

Here's the breakdown:

**HKHK_3** runs on CMI routing (China Mobile International). The cool part? If you grab a CN2 GIA plan from their US locations, you can migrate to HKHK_3 for free. Real-world testing shows video streaming speeds hitting 260,000+—pretty solid for 4K content delivery.

**HKHK_8** is the premium option with full CN2 GIA direct routing. Lower latency, minimal packet loss, consistently strong performance. Yeah, it costs more, but when you're running applications that absolutely cannot afford downtime or lag spikes, it's worth every dollar.

Both facilities share one major improvement: faster connection establishment and more stable data transmission. Less waiting around, fewer "why is this taking so long" moments.

## The KiwiVM Control Panel Got Smarter

BandwagonHost overhauled their KiwiVM management interface, and this one's a big quality-of-life upgrade.

Previously, switching data centers meant the system copied your entire disk—every single file, whether you needed it or not. Slow process, higher risk of something going sideways mid-migration.

The new approach? It migrates just your actual data. Faster transfers, reduced complexity, lower chance of migration failures. You're looking at significantly shorter downtime windows when moving between facilities.

If you've avoided switching data centers because you dreaded the wait time, that pain point just got a lot smaller.

## CN2 GIA Plans: What You're Actually Getting

BandwagonHost's CN2 GIA lineup remains their sweet spot for balanced performance and pricing. You get access to 19 data center locations globally—Los Angeles DC6 and DC9, Japan Softbank, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, and more.

Here's what makes these plans flexible: buy any CN2 GIA package, and you can self-migrate to supported locations like HKHK_3 through your control panel. No tickets, no waiting for support responses. Just point, click, done.

For Hong Kong CN2 GIA specifically (HKHK_8), you're looking at premium specs:

- **2 cores, 2GB RAM**: $89.99/month, 500GB bandwidth, 40GB SSD, 1Gbps network
- **4 cores, 4GB RAM**: $155.99/month, 1000GB bandwidth, 80GB SSD, 1Gbps network
- **6 cores, 8GB RAM**: $299.99/month, 2000GB bandwidth, 160GB SSD, 1Gbps network  
- **8 cores, 16GB RAM**: $589.99/month, 4000GB bandwidth, 320GB SSD, 1Gbps network

All plans run KVM virtualization with 1Gbps port speeds.

## Who Should Care About This Upgrade

If you're running cross-border e-commerce platforms, managing remote teams with China-based operations, or distributing video content to mainland audiences, these Hong Kong nodes make a tangible difference. Lower latency translates directly to better user experience—faster page loads, smoother video playback, more responsive applications.

The HKHK_3 option (CMI routing via CN2 GIA plan migration) gives you a budget-friendly entry point. The HKHK_8 direct CN2 GIA route is your go-to when performance absolutely cannot be compromised.

Neither option is overkill if your business actually depends on reliable China connectivity. The real question is whether you need premium stability (HKHK_8) or solid performance with better value (HKHK_3).

## Common Questions

**Which Hong Kong facility should I choose?**  
Depends on your budget and performance requirements. HKHK_3 (accessible via CN2 GIA migration) offers excellent value with strong CMI routing. HKHK_8 delivers top-tier CN2 GIA direct connections with minimal latency—ideal for mission-critical applications.

**What's the real difference between CN2 GIA and CMI routing?**  
CN2 GIA is China Telecom's premium network tier: faster speeds, better stability, higher costs. CMI (China Mobile International) provides strong international connectivity at more accessible pricing. Both work well; your choice depends on whether you prioritize absolute performance or cost efficiency.

**Can I switch data centers after purchasing?**  
Yes. CN2 GIA plan holders can freely migrate between supported locations through the KiwiVM control panel—no additional fees for switching to nodes like HKHK_3, Australia, or other available facilities.

**How long does data center migration actually take now?**  
The optimized migration process significantly reduces transfer time compared to the old full-disk copy method. Exact duration varies by your data volume, but expect noticeably faster completion than previous migration experiences.

## Bottom Line

BandwagonHost's Hong Kong network upgrades deliver real improvements where it matters: connection speed, stability, and migration convenience. The HKHK_3 and HKHK_8 facilities now handle traffic more efficiently, while the streamlined KiwiVM migration process removes a major friction point for users managing multiple data center locations.
